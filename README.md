# Data_structure_-_Algo
This repo contains my code for Data structure and Algo in C++

PROGRAM LIST:
1.  Implement menu driven program for operations (traverse, insert , delete, linear search, selection sort ) on an  array.
2.  Implement sparse matrix
3.  Implement menu driven program for operations (push, pop) on a stack using arrays. Check the status of the stack whether there is underflow or overflow.[Max size of Stack = 5]
4.  Implement the conversion of infix notation to postfix notation using stacks
5.  Implement binary search using recursion
6.  Program :Implement menu driven program for operations (enqueue,dequeue) on a queue using arrays. Check the status of the stack whether there is underflow or overflow. 
    [Max size of Stack = 5]   
7.  Implement evaluation of postfix notation using stacks.
8.  Implement Tower of Hanoi problem
9.  Implement menu driven program for insertion (at the beginning, at specified location, at the end) & deletion (at the beginning, at specified location, at the end) on singly       linked list, circular single linked list.
10. Implement menu driven program for insertion (at the beginning, at specified location, at the end) & deletion (at the beginning, at specified location, at the end) on doubly 
    Double Linked List and circular doubly Double Linked List.
11. Implement stacks and queues using linked list - use single linked list
12. Implement addition of two polynomial expressions using singly linked list.
13. Implement linear search and selection sort in a single linked list.
14. Write a program to count the total number of nodes & reverse the singly linked list.
15. Write a program to merge 2 sorted linked list and display the final sorted linked list.
16. Implement menu driven program for operations on Binary Search Tree (Insertion, Deletion, Search, Traversals (using recursion)-Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).
17. Implement Inorder,Preorder,Postorder traversals on Binary Search Tree (using STACKS)
