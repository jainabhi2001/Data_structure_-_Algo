# Data_structure_-_Algo
This repo contains my code for Data structure and Algo in C++

PROGRAM LIST:
1. Implement menu driven program for operations (traverse, insert , delete, linear search, selection sort ) on an  array.
2. Implement sparse matrix
3. Implement menu driven program for operations (push, pop) on a stack using arrays. Check the status of the stack whether there is underflow or overflow.[Max size of Stack = 5]
4. Implement the conversion of infix notation to postfix notation using stacks
5. Implement binary search using recursion
6. Program :Implement menu driven program for operations (enqueue,dequeue) on a queue using arrays. Check the status of the stack whether there is underflow or overflow. 
   [Max size of Stack = 5]   
7. Implement evaluation of postfix notation using stacks.
8. Implement Tower of Hanoi problem
